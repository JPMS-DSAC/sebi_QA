In view of the above, vide e-mail dated September 09, 2018, SEBI sought explanation from the Company in this regard. The Company in its reply vide e-mail dated October 03, 2018 submitted that the Noticee had been holding the 84,200 shares of the Company from the date of listing of the shares of the Company i.e. September 18, 2000. The details of the Noticee shareholding had been included in the category ‘Promoter and Promoter Group’ shareholding of the Company, from June 2013 till date, pursuant to the intimation from Noticee. The Company further submitted that the said error was inadvertent and was adequately rectified by it, when it came to its notice. 5. Regulation 13(2A) read with 13(5) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as ‘PIT Regulations, 1992’) provides that, any person who is a promoter or part of promoter group of a listed company shall disclose to the company in Form B the number of shares or voting rights held by such person, within two working days of becoming such promoter or person belonging to promoter group. From the facts of the case and information provided by the Company, it was alleged that the Noticee, being a promoter in the Company had No disclosed the shares held by it in the Company from the date of listing i.e. September 18, 2000 of the scrip, till June 30, 2013, when its shareholding appeared for the first time under the category of promoters’ shareholding. It is observed that there is a delay in disclosing the shareholding of the Noticee in the Company. In view of the above, it has been alleged that the Noticee has violated Regulation 13(2A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992. 6. The competent authority in SEBI prima facie felt satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to adjudicate upon the alleged violations of the provisions of Regulation 13(2A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 by the Noticee. Accordingly, Shri Santosh Shukla, Chief General Manager had been appointed as Adjudicating Officer (‘erstwhile AO’) in the matter and had been advised to inquire and adjudge under Rule 5 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and imposing penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred as ‘Adjudication Rules’) and under section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, for the alleged violation of the aforesaid provision by the Noticee. Subsequently, by a common communication-order dated January 07, 2020, this case was transferred to the undersigned with the advice that except for the change of the Adjudicating Officer, the other terms and conditions of the original orders ‘shall remain unchanged and shall be in full force and effect’ and that the “Adjudicating Officer shall proceed in accordance with the terms of reference made in the original orders”. Adjudication Order in respect of in respect of Zeppelin Investments P Ltd in the matter of Nagpur Power & Industries Limited. 7. Accordingly, in terms of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules read with section 15I of the SEBI Act, the notice to show cause No EAD-2 AP AKS 2751 2020 dated January 21, 2020 (hereinafter referred as ‘SCN’) was issued to the Noticee, calling upon it to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be held against it in terms of Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules and penalty be No imposed under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act for the aforesaid alleged violations. The relevant provisions of the PIT Regulations, 1992 charged in this case are reproduced hereinafter: PIT Regulations, 1992 13. Disclosure of interest or holding in listed companies by certain persons - Initial Disclosure. (2A) Any person who is a promoter or part of promoter group of a listed company shall disclose to the company in Form B the number of shares or voting rights held by such person, within two working days of becoming such promoter or person belonging to promoter group. (5) The disclosure mentioned in sub-regulations 54[(3), (4) and (4A)] shall be made within two working days of: (a) the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares, or (b) the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights, as the case may be. 8. The SCN was duly served upon the Noticee. Vide letter dated February 06, 2020, the Noticee requested for ten working days’ extension to file its reply to the SCN as it has to check its past records to file suitable reply to the SCN. Considering the request of the Noticee and in the interest of principles of natural justice, undersigned granted an opportunity of personal hearing to the Noticee in terms of Rule 4(3) of the Adjudication Rules on February 28, 2020 and allowed it to file its reply to the SCN by February 26, 2020 in the matter. 9. Thereafter, vide letter dated February 25, 2020 the Noticee filed its reply to the SCN and made submissions inter alia as follows: a. The Noticee held 84,200 shares in the Company from the date of its listing on September 18, 2000 and continued to hold till August, 2018. b. The allegation on violation of Regulation 13(2A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 on account of delay of 12 years 9 months 10 days (4666 days since September 21, 2000) is baseless and unsubstantiated as Regulation 13(2A) was itself inserted vide SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2011 w.e.f. 16-08-2011. Adjudication Order in respect of in respect of Zeppelin Investments P Ltd in the matter of Nagpur Power & Industries Limited. c. The language of Regulation 13(2A) is No as clear as provided under Regulation 7(1) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as ‘PIT Regulations, 2015’). The same is reproduced hereunder: PIT Regulations, 2015 “7. (1) Initial Disclosures (a). Every promoter, member of the promoter group, key managerial personnel and director of every company whose securities are listed on any recognised stock exchange shall disclose his holding of securities of the company as on the date of these regulations taking effect, to the company within thirty days of these regulations taking effect; (b). Every person on appointment as a key managerial personnel or a director of the company or upon becoming a promoter or member of the promoter group shall disclose his holding of securities of the company as on the date of appointment or becoming a promoter, to the company within seven days of such appointment or becoming a promoter.” d. As on the date of the commencement of the amended provisions in August 2011, the Noticee was already holding shares of the Company. The amended provision did No seem to mandate furnishing of initial disclosure by existing promoter and promoter group. It rather indicated that disclosure was required to be given on becoming such promoter or person belonging to promoter group. Therefore, it assumed that there was no requirement to disclose the existing holdings as on the date of the amended regulations taking effect. e. It was later observed by the Noticee that its name was No reflecting in the ‘promoter group’ of the shareholding pattern filed by the Company with the stock exchange. Therefore, the Noticee furnished the disclosure under Regulation 13(2A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 on June 28, 2013, despite there being no specific requirement to furnish the same. Consequently, the Noticee was shown under ‘Promoter and Promoter Group’ in the shareholding pattern filed by the Company with the stock exchanges for quarter ended June, 2013. Accordingly, there has been no delay of 12 years, 9 months and 10 days (4,666 days since September 21, 2000) in disclosing the shareholding by the Company as stated in the SCN. f. In view of the Noticee submissions, the SCN lacks credible evidence and needs to be dropped. 10. On schedule date of hearing, the authorized representatives of the Noticee viz. Ms. Vinita Nair, Practicing Company Secretary and Ms. Nidhi Sultanpuria appeared before undersigned for hearing and made submissions on behalf of the Noticee on the lines of Noticees’s reply dated February 25, 2020. Adjudication Order in respect of in respect of Zeppelin Investments P Ltd in the matter of Nagpur Power & Industries Limited. 11. I have considered the allegation levelled in the terms of reference, the relevant material brought on record and reply submissions of the Noticee made before undersigned. In this case, the fact about the Noticee being a promoter of the Company and holding 84,200 shares of the Company since September 18, 2000 is an admitted position. It is also an admitted fact that the Noticee made disclosure to the Company about its shareholding in the Company on June 28, 2013. The limited question for determination is as to whether the Noticee had failed to make disclosures to the company as required under Regulation 13(2A) read with Regulation 13(5) of the PIT Regulations, 1992. In this regard, I note that Regulation 13(2A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 had been inserted via an amendment and came into effect from August 16, 2011. 12. The Noticee has contended that the amended provision Regulation 13(2A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 did No seem to mandate furnishing of initial disclosure by existing promoter and promoter group. It rather indicates that disclosure is required to be given on becoming such promoter or person belonging to promoter group. In this regard, I note that, as per the language of Regulation 13(2A), the compliance obligation of a promoter to make disclosure to the company in Form B within two working days’ triggers when – (a) it becomes a promoter of the company; or (b) it becomes a person belonging to promoter group of the company. 13. Further, Regulation 13(2A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 came into force from August 16, 2011 and the Noticee was holding 84,200 shares of the Company from the date of listing of shares i.e. September 18, 2000. In view of the same, I am of the view that the provisions of Regulation 13(2A) cannot be applied retrospectively and therefore, the Noticee cannot be held liable for failure to make disclosures under Regulation 13(2A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992, since the shares were already held on the date of listing, which is prior to coming into the force of Regulation 13(2A). I am, therefore, of the view that the case does No deserve imposition of any monetary penalty and the SCN is accordingly disposed of. 14. In terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to SEBI. Date: March 04, 2020 Amit Pradhan Place: Mumbai Adjudicating Officer'"

Vide letter dated February 07, 2018, Ms. Nirmala was once again called upon to file reply to the SCN latest by February 14, 2018. Also, an opportunity of hearing was granted to Ms.Nirmala in the matter on February 23, 2018. 8. Vide email (cs@goenkadiamonds.com) dated February 21, 2018, informed that the noticee will appear for the hearing and the written submissions will be made after the hearing. In this regard, vide email dated February 22, 2018, Ms. Nirmala was reminded to file reply to the SCN. 9. On the date of hearing, Ms. Nirmala along with her representative appeared and made submissions. Further, they informed that written submissions shall be made by February 26, 2018. 10. Vide email dated February 23, 2018, Ms. Nirmala filed reply to the SCN, which are as follows: a. The present submissions are being filed post the submissions made during the personal hearing in the matter held on February 23, 2018 to summarize the key submissions made during the personal hearing. b. The Noticee admits that there was no disclosures made by the Noticee under Regulation 29(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 2011 and Regulation 13(1), 13(4A) and 13(5) of the SEBI Insider Trading Regulations, 1992. Before any disclosures as required could be made, there were internal disputes between the family which resulted in the transferor Mr. Nitin Goenka file a case against his mother, who is the Noticee alleging fraudulent transfer of the subject shares. The entire shares therefore was subjected to a freeze order by the Investigation Department, Crime Branch where an FIR was registered. The Noticee had to obtain Anticipatory Bail from the Hon’ble High Court in this regard. Copy of the directions issued by the Police to the depository participant of the Noticee is attached herewith. There is no voting rights which were exercised by the Noticee till date further to the freeze and the shares too are frozen in the demat account. However, the Noticee appreciates that there is a default in the present matter for which the Noticee requests the learned Adjudicating Officer to take a lenient view in the matter. c. The disclosure which was required was a onetime disclosure which was omitted by the Noticee on account of the circumstances explained above. Further, there was no advisors or full time Company Secretary at the time of the dispute who were all under investigation because of the allegations in the Complaint. There is no loss caused to any investor in this regard as the said transfer is within the promoter group. The Noticee has not gained any advantage out of the same but has been victimised and is subjected to huge restraints and loss because of the said transfer of shares. d. We draw your kind attention to the other order of the learned Adjudication Officer where a view as framed by the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Vitro Commodities Private Limited V SEBI was taken. In other words, the learned Adjudicating Officer is humbly requested to consider taking the same position in Adjudication Order in the matter of Goenka Diamond and Jewels Ltd.– Noticee Ms. Nirmala Goenka Page 2 of 4 the present matter where no separate penalties under the Takeover Regulations and Insider Trading Regulations be imposed. e. This is our submission on the quantum of penalty without prejudice to our submission that the delay in the disclosures may not be viewed seriously to warrant any penalty and a lenient view be taken. The Noticee has been compliant with all the regulations and will be more diligent in future. The spirt underlying any regulatory intervention by SEBI is to make the Noticee realize the mistakes and to adopt a corrective path in future dealings. While this has been a single on off event of non-disclosure, yet the Noticee undertakes to be more diligent and careful in nature. CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS:- 11. Charges levelled against Ms. Nirmala as per SCN, submissions of Ms. Nirmala in reply to SCN, and the documents available on record have been perused. The issues that arise for consideration are : a) Whether, Ms. Nirmala had violated the respective provisions as alleged in the SCN? b) If yes, does the violation, on the part of Ms. Nirmala attract monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of SEBI Act? c) If yes, what quantum of monetary penalty should be imposed on the Ms. Nirmala taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act? Issue a) Whether, Noticee have violated the respective provisions as alleged in the SCN? 13. 12. Ms. Nirmala, Promoter of Goenka, held 1,03,50,000 shares (3.19% of the share capital of Goenka). On November 11, 2013, Ms. Nirmala received 4,09,76,250 shares (12.93% of the share capital of Goenka), which resulted in change in holdings of Ms. Nirmala in Goenka to 16.19% (5,13,26,250 shares). It is pertinent to take note of the submissions made by Nitin, the other noticee in the matter, in which he had contested that the disclosure would arise only in case of change in the shareholding. It has been contested that the very transfer of the shares out of his account itself is being agitated in the court of law as the same has been alleged to have been fraudulently done. Given the same, it has been mentioned that the competent authority has applied a freeze on the holding and thus neither Mr. Nitin nor Ms. Nirmala are able to exercise any rights arising out the disputed holding. 14. Before proceeding further, the conduct of the Noticee to be placed on record. The Noticee in her reply has failed to submit the correct and complete facts of the matter. It is pertinent to mention that the Ld. Session Court of Greater Mumbai vide order (dt: January 10, 2014) has rejected the application of the Noticee for anticipatory bail on the ground that: a. The evidence collected by the investigating agency as pointed out above clear in terms prima facto pointing out that the gift deed and release deed are forged and fabricated. So also, on the basis of the forged signature of the informant on TIFD slip the shares are transferred from the demat account to the account of the applicant. b. The papers of investigation further indicates that the accused and the co accused Navneet Goenka signed the documents and the forged and fabricated documents are tendered by the co Adjudication Order in the matter of Goenka Diamond and Jewels Ltd.– Noticee Ms. Nirmala Goenka Page 3 of 4 accused Navneet Goenka and managed to get transferred huge shares of the informant to the account of the applicant. She is beneficiary of the crime. In absence of the informant all these acts are committed therefore she is part of conspiracy. c. The offence charged against the applicant (Nirmala) is certainly serious in nature. She has direct nexus with the alleged crime. In order to unearth the conspiracy her custodial interrogation is essential. She has not come before the Court with clean hands. Therefore, according to me, the applicant failed to make out the case for grant of anticipatory bail. 15. Also, during the pendency of the anticipatory bail proceedings of others, in the mediation proceedings before an Additional Sessional Judge, a Settlement Agreement dated March 18, 2014 in mediation proceedings was arrived. Such facts were not before the Adjudicating Officer, which are pertinent to come to arrive a conclusion on the matter pending before the Adjudicating Officer. It is observed that the conduct of the Noticee as observed by the honorable Court continues even in these proceedings, as full facts were not brought out. 16. Given the specific observations of the competent authority on the veracity as well as the legality of the transaction leading to the change in the holding of Ms. Nirmala, it would not be appropriate to adjudge this matter at this stage until the Competent Authority decides the matter. Issue b) If yes, does the violation, on the part of Ms. Nirmala attract monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of SEBI Act? Issue c) If yes, what quantum of monetary penalty should be imposed on the Ms. Nirmala taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act? 17. As the violations are not established against Ms. Nirmala, consequent issues b and c requires no further examination. ORDER 18. For the aforesaid reasons, Show Cause Notice SEBI/HO/EAD- 8/JS/NS/OW/P/21819/1/2017 dated September 11, 2017, alleging violations of provisions of Regulation 29(1) read with Regulation 29(3) of Takeover Regulations and Regulation 13(1) and 13(4A) read with Regulation 13(5) of PIT Regulations, is disposed of without imposition of any penalty.
